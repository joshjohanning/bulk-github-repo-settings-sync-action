# Advanced configuration file for bulk-github-repo-settings-sync-action
# This format supports multiple rules with different selectors and settings

# Organization to operate on (required for custom-property selectors)
owner: my-org

# Rules are processed in order. Each rule specifies:
# - A selector (repos list, custom-property filter, or "all")
# - Settings to apply to matching repositories
#
# If a repository matches multiple rules, settings are merged (later rules override earlier ones)
rules:
  # Rule 1: Platform repos get strict security settings

# Alternative simpler format - just repos with overrides (backwards compatible)
# Use this if you don't need custom property filtering
# See sample-configuration/repos.yml for this format
#
# repos:
#   - repo: my-org/repo1
#     allow-squash-merge: true
#   - repo: my-org/repo2
#     topics: 'javascript,automation'
#   - my-org/repo3 # Simple string format, uses default settings
